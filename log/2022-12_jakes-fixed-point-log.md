## 2022 12 14 

OK today I'm trying to whip the integrator up to use fixed point maths... and bring the integrator rate way up, I think as a baseline the current integrator runs in ~ 100us, or something? I run the integrator on a 250us period, so hopefully we can crank that to a ~ 50us integrator period, with 5us integration step or less. 

I think I have the basics here, 

```cpp
// where's the radix... picking 16 (the middle) ~ arbitrarily 
// so we have 2^16 = 65 536 dots after the pt, (0.000015...)
// and 2^16 = 65 536 dots in front of the pt, so we have max vals (accel, pos, etc) +/- 32.5k, not bad, 
const int32_t fp_scale = 16;

// get explicit abt which are fixed point ints, 
typedef int32_t fpint32_t;

// and ops w/ em 
float fp_fixedToFloat(fpint32_t fixed);
fpint32_t fp_floatToFixed(float flt);
int32_t fp_fixedToInt(fpint32_t fixed);
fpint32_t fp_intToFixed(int32_t inty);

// addition & subtraction is just integer addition, straight up 
// but w/ multiplication we need a little scaling, so: 
fpint32_t fp_mult(fpint32_t a, fpint32_t b);
fpint32_t fp_div(fpint32_t num, fpint32_t denum);
```

```cpp
// hmmm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S12qx1DwjVk& at ~ 18:00 
float fp_fixedToFloat(fpint32_t fixed){
  return ((float)fixed / (float)(1 << fp_scale));
}

// actually this is unclear to me... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S12qx1DwjVk& at 16:57
fpint32_t fp_floatToFixed(float flt){
  return (flt * (float)(1 << fp_scale));
}

int32_t fp_fixedToInt(fpint32_t fixed){
  return (fixed >> fp_scale);
}

fpint32_t fp_intToFixed(int32_t inty){
  return (inty << fp_scale); 
}

// w/ fixed point mult, we have some out-of-ranging trouble, 
// we can maybe do this w/ 64-bit ints, but it's going to suck a little bit of time
// though still better than the floating point libs, 
fp_int32_t fp_mult(fpint32_t a, fpint32_t b){
  return ((int64_t)(a) * (int64_t)(b)) >> fp_scale;
}
// we can instead do it w/ some fancy shifting, but I'm not going to get into this yet: 
// leaving it as a potential speedup... 
// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npQF28g6s_k& 7:40 
// fp_int32_t fp_mult(fpint32_t a, fpint32_t b){
//   return ((a >> 6) * (b >> 6)) >> 4;
// }

// division...
fpint32_t fp_div(fpint32_t num, fpint32_t denum){
  return ((int64_t)(num) << fp_scale) / denum;
}
```

So I can more or less dead-nuts replace the current integrator with these maths, then see if I can get similar results as what I had previously. 

## 2022 12 15 

Alrigh I've this loaded and running and, yeah, integrator runs now around 4us relative the previous ~ 50... looks like I would be OK running the integrator up to 10KHz, maybe 20? But does it still work... Hmm - more like 4us when everything is inactive, 10-20us when it's chugging along actually doing maths. 

I think the crux of the manner in which this is currently set up is that there's a big dynamic range between the ~ position, velocity values, and the delta-T, which is very small (0.0001 here, w/ 100us time). 

Better would be to store speeds, etc, in delta-T base time? But we then also invite a suspiciously large amount of converting-in-and-out fkery. 

I think I'm going to carry on w/ this, then think about adding precision later on... first, will try to add the dead-reckoning integration steps. 

OK, it's ~ happening, as is the dead reckoning bit of the integrator, but I'm having scaling troubles... on position, especially, and also the stop distance maths is not working: maybe that's also scaling things out of range? 

I should print stopDistance and positionDelta out of the state endpoint, perhaps, to debug a little better? Then I can come up with a better scaling... solution, something ? Maybe I should just set my integrator up so that the integration step... or the delT is some power of 2? 

Yep - I think I am scaling outside of my ranges, while doing this line:

```cpp
// for vf = 0, d = (vel^2) / (2 * a)
stopDistance = fp_div(fp_mult(vel, vel), fp_mult(fp_intToFixed(2), maxAccel));
```

Since ~ vals here are 200 (for vel, with steps-rep at motor being ~ 4k), so * 2 = 16 million, easily out of range. We need a better way to calculate stopping distnace... or a better way to span these dynamic ranges. 

Certainly one approach would be to do all of this maths up front, send some simpler representation downstream... 

OK, I unfk-d this by elevating the whole calc into doubles:

```cpp
// big-div, 
fpint32_t fp_calcStopDistance(fpint32_t _vel, fpint32_t _maxAccel){
  int64_t _velSq = ((int64_t)(_vel) * (int64_t)(_vel)) >> fp_scale;
  int64_t _accelTwo = ((int64_t)(_maxAccel) * (int64_t)(fp_intToFixed(2))) >> fp_scale;
  return (_velSq << fp_scale) / _accelTwo;
}
```

That's the basics, then, but I think I need some position scalar... we can perhaps have this-scale velocity, etc, but can't do it with position - for sure. 

### Time Bases

I think the trouble here is in ranges w/r/t time bases: if we have our fixed point after 16 bits, we have 65k ticks on either side: so max. range of a position value, i.e., is 32k on either end. Taken with SPU in the way, that's ~ 800, or 400mm (around). Not enough. However, it is (barely) enough precision to do speeds w/r/t *one second* - units / sec, etc: where our **delta-tee** is ~ `0.0001` (for a 10khz clock), so, only ~ kind of inside of our epsilon of `0.000015` 

The trouble is that speeds need (relatively) high precision, but are hampered by this tiny delta-tee multiplication where i.e. `velocity = accel * delT` or `pos = vel * delT` at each step. Positions, in the same precision, need more *range* 

If we move the time base around, we can *move decimal places relative in speed* while **expanding those in position** - which is not time-based. 

Eh - actually, after looking at this... the middle ground uses `units/ms` as a timebase, and use fixed point w/ 8 bits (or 9...) (!) of resolution after the dot.

![fixedpoint-maths](images/2022-12-15_fixed-points-01.png)

These are ~ fine as is, maybe, but does a little better with a 10ms timebase, a little awkward, but here we are: same position resolutions, then with 1000mm/sec max rate (with SPU applied, etc). 

I think a more sane approach would be to just roll position around somehow... it seems ~ somewhat inevitable... that amounts to not changing the existing code too much, save for the wrapping-integer, and for looking a little differently at target positions. 

### Rollover

OK: I think... my insight so far is that we really want speeds in per-tick units, so we're not doing any multiplication... and we want to use the fact that *we never integrate a delta of more than one* to roll position into a much larger counter... I think this way we can end up with pretty huge dynamic range, but I am apparently out of time today to figure it out. 

my goals next:

- work out how to use the above insight (per-tick delta never > 1) to properly divide units, 
  - should be one intentional position rollover
  - we still need ~ bigish speed ranges, right ? or what ?
    - how do speed ranges relate to real-speed-ranges ? 
    - check that our maths in that sheet was accurate ? isn't real-rate-ranges actually monstrous, given small-timebase-units ??? 
    - i.e. velocity would *never* be > than 1.0, in this world...

OK, starting to make more sense. This is fundamental, so worth some slow work, though I'm equally impatient with it... tomorrow. 

- the last trick is like... this distance-to-stop calculation, that's across scales, innit ? maybe the 64-bit expansion still covers in that case, or maybe not, maybe we have to calculate something else up front, like that state-space slope... which is the same maths anyways, isn't it? 

## 2022 12 20 

OK, IIRC this is ~ basically working, but not quite, and we have elected for `2.30` fixed points, where we use the vast majority of our bits behind the point, stash rates in a velocity-per-integration-unit-unit, then rollover into a 64-bit fixed point position that's basically `34.30` fixed point: far more range than we'll ever need, and far more precision than we'll ever need.

Then we'll need to implement that in the code, get it up to testing... and I think think about our epsilons, absolute rates, etc, and try to guard against 'em. 

Hmmm... it's working-ish, though integration steps are still large-ish on account of (I think) much use of 64-bit integers... in particular, the stopping distance calculation. 

Perhaps the en-quickening way to to this would be to calculate that up front, rather than at every integration step... in some way, we're defining a velocity-and-accel boundary (?). 

Yeah, this would be the smarts then: it reduces also the integration time back from ~ 40us to ~4us, meaning we could approach 100kHz if we'd like. So, next I'll figure how to calculate "stopping distance" up front, even though it's a rate-dependent calculation. 

### When2Decel State Machine

MK, this is 

```cpp
// how far to stop, at end ? 
// for vf = 0, d = (vel^2) / (2 * a)
// or d / (2 * a) = vel ^ 2
```

Or, more easily considered on the v-t plot ? though it doesn't tell us anything about distance. We want to define a boundary in our easily-available state space (vel, dist), that, if crossed, tells us to deccel. 

But, I mean, IDK what to say here: we have a stopping distance:

$$
d = \frac{v^2}{2a}
$$

Which, fwiw, is more involved when we have nonzero vf, but not that bad.

Maybe in terms of time-to-deccel, though another division appears:

$$
0 = v_i + at
$$

$$
t = \frac{-v_i}{a}
$$

And distance within that time:

$$
d = \frac{v_i + v_f}{2} * t
$$

$$
d = \frac{v_i}{2} * t
$$

I mean, the div/two is fast, innit, but the $/a$ isn't, and we can see that the above is just going to land us at our original $d = v^2 / 2a$ stopping distance calculation... like, this is just kinematics, the boundary I'm looking for *is* that formulation. 

I'm trying it this way since I want to run it as a state machine, but it might just be that I have to calculate the whole trapezoid up front - as is the case w/ everyone else who runs these types of codes. 

I don't want to do that just yet - I'd like to try the last trick of rm'ing the *a* term... 

$$
da = v^2 / 2 
$$

This at least makes the div/two into `>> 2` - real quick. Let's see... then if I have 

```cpp
stopDA = posDelta * accel;
maxStopDA = (v*v) >> 2;
```

So...

$$
d = \frac{v^2}{2a}
$$

To sanity check... previously I was decelerating if my stopping distance w/ this maxed accel & current rate was larger (or equal) to my current distance from the target, I would start slowing down. 

It's two distance comparisons, and since $a$ is constant here, it means I should be able to compare the distances, multipled to A, 

OP, I think I am learning that `>>` is "arithmetic" right shift whereas `>>>` is logical - and `>>` shifts in ones on the left, leading to these -ve numbers... 

oof, IDK - I think, for starters, my max accel is whackity huge, I'm going up to 200 units / sec in one tick. 

Yeah, for some reason I am not using accel here at all, it's getting pinned immediately... something something, scaling on the way down... IDK if I will manage to sort this out today, ffs. 

Oye yeah check it out, here's the condition we want, when this is true we want to start sloooowen down:

$$
d_{2targ} < d_{2stop} = \frac{v^2}{2a}
$$

So we can move the constants over, to compare:

$$
(2a * d_{2targ}) < (2a*d_{2stop}) = v^2
$$

Here's our comparison:

$$
(2a_{max} * d_{2targ}) <  v^2
$$

This is mucho-better looking, though I think my $2a_{max} * d_{2targ}$ maths is looking pretty sus; I should expect it to be dropping consistently as the distance-to-target decreases, it's just jumping all over though. 

OK this ends up ~ like so:

```cpp
// ~ previously:
#define FP_STOPCALC_REDUCE 4
// I think it's like this:
// (x << 1) == (x * 2), that's gorgus, 
// and we're going to do this... with a little less prescision, as accel can be punishing:
// that's the (x >> 16) in each of these terms... 
twoDA = ((distanceToTarget << 1) >> FP_STOPCALC_REDUCE) * ((int64_t)(maxAccel) >> FP_STOPCALC_REDUCE);
//abs(((((int64_t)(2 << fp_scale) * distanceToTarget) >> fp_scale) * (int64_t)(maxAccel)));
vSquared = ((int64_t)(vel >> FP_STOPCALC_REDUCE) * (int64_t)(vel >> FP_STOPCALC_REDUCE));
// we can use that to compare when-2-stop, 
```

w/o the reducing term we overrun the `twoDA` etc calcs when our accels are, like, greater than 1 unit/sec in real space, lol. So - that's feeling stable for now, I think I can rest easy on those laurels for the holiday, proceeding with sequential motion when I return / when I get into machines next. 

## 2023 01 12

OK I'm back to try to merge this into main, but have just noticed that -ve deltas produce not-good results, like, even bad, haha - no motion! 

Should be simple enough, applying an abs() somewhere it isn't yet... 

OK yeah that was that, seems to work. Should test... with ~

```js
await mtr.setCurrentScale(0.55)
await mtr.setVelocity(1000)
await mtr.setAccel(10000)
for(let v = 0; v < 100; v ++){
  let targ = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2000
  console.warn(`setting targ ${targ.toFixed(2)}`)
  await mtr.target(targ)
  await delay(100)
}
await mtr.absolute(0)
await mtr.setCurrentScale(0.00)
```

- using random .velocity() calls, OK
- using random .absolute() calls, OK
- using random .relative() calls, OK
- using random .target() calls, OK
- unfk. the api reporting... 

OK, that all seems done, I'm going to merge this into main and then take another crakko at sequential motion...

## Perf Goals

- from 50us integration step, 250us integration period 
  - to 5us step, 50us period 
- better than this 0.000092 "delT" (where reality is 0.0001) - that's 8 % error on everything, bad ! - could swap to milliseconds timebase for velocities, etc? 
  - absolute bounds 
- reporting on abs-max accels, vels, based on delT *and* fixed point range?
